    <h1>
      OK so this game kinda confusing.
    </h1>
    <p1>Yea I know. Anyways time for a brief overview of the things i  didn't cover in the tutorial. </p1>
    <h3><em><i>Differences Between Characters</i></em></h3> 
      <p>Ok so these characters are not actually identical. They have a few key differences:
		  <ul>
			<li>Dave(Cyan Square) cannot jump off of Bounce Pads. This is to balance the ability the squares have to jump off of one another. Also i forgot to add it.</li>
			<li>Dave can't be launched by the Level 2 cannon.</li>
<li>Dave explodes in Purple instead of cyan because reasons.</li>
			  <li>Generally, turrets will prefer to target Bob over Dave.</li>
			</ul>
Other than that, heres some general common sense! 
			<ul>
			<li>In Level 2, get the ball into the cannon to win! (note: if you don't win, then I probobly messed something up. Whoops. I blame George Bush and standardised schooling.)</li>
	<li>Turrets shoot cannonballs, but they shoot them badly. If you stand still, they usually can't hit you.</li>
<li>In Level 1, you need  to move the bounce pad in order to collect the powerup.</li>
				<li>Get a running start on the ball in order to punt it a decent distance.</li>
			</ul>
