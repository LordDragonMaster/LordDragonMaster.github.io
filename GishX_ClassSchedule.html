      <h1> Alright here's my required schedule place.</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Period 1: Latin</h2>
      <h3>Teacher: Mr. Crabb</h3>
      <h3>Room: A212</h3>
      <h3>Time: 7:30-8:17</h3>
	    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Details</button> 
			   <div class="content">First period I have Latin with Mr. Crabb. As a general rule, all languange classes really really suck, but latin seems to suck the least. <button type="button" class="collapsible">small note</button> <div class="content">(just so you know, Mr. Casual, Chinese class sucks the most. I took it in middle school and we had a new teacher every year because they kept leaving for KP. You have to memorize every individual character. It was the worst. also, these buttons work inside of eachother, which is pretty cool.)</div> He's a pretty good teacher(especially compared to other language teachers), but my Latin teacher last year was way nicer and more fun. I miss you Mrs. Kebernick, you were very based.</div>
      <h2>Period 2: Cooperative Physical & Health Education</h2>
      <h3>Teacher: Mr. Robinson</h3>
      <h3>Room: AG06</h3>
      <h3>Time: 8:21 - 9:12</h3>
	  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Details</button> 
			   <div class="content">Second period varies. Usually I have nothing period 2 so i can chill in the library, but on Wednsdays I have community(which is a useless class by the way) and occasionally I have a wellness period because we were required to take those, and that's kinda lame. The description of this particular class was rather misleading, none of us knew what the actual class was until we were in it.</div>
      <h2>Period 3: Game and Web Design</h2>
      <h3>Teacher: Mr. Fortuna</h3>
      <h3>Room: HG06</h3>
      <h3>Time: 9:16 - 10:03</h3>
	  	  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Details</button> 
			   <div class="content">Third period I have Game and Web Design with Mr. Casual himself (I know you're reading this mr. casual). He's pretty chill tho, doesn't give out homework so this is basically my favorite class this year. wish my Intro To Computer Science class last year was half as cool (Mrs. Brown if you are reading this i'm gonna kidnap ur dog(for legal reasons thats a joke. i got sent to the office once for mentioning the second amendment in a paper. darn libs (for non legal reasons that's also a joke.(seriously Mrs. brown SCRATCH IS NOT A CODING LANGUAGE I SIGNED UP EXPECTING JAVASCRIPT AND GOT <i>SCRATCH</i> YOU ARE WORSE THAN MOST SUBS I'VE HAD AND I'VE HAD SOME PRETTY BAD SUBS)))) Anyways, Game and Web Design is the reason why I am rantng and rambling about my classes. How do I ramble  while typing? Good question. Tell me if you figure it out.</div>

      <h3>Teacher: N/A</h3>
      <h3>Room: Cafeteria</h3>
      <h3>Time: 10:07 - 10:53</h3>
	  	  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Details</button> 
			   <div class="content">Fourth Period I have Lunch, which they should call Library cause that's where I always am, usually reading or doing homework I should have done already or avoiding doing homework i should have done already. I'm such a responsible student. :D</div>
      <h2>Period 5: World Literature</h2>
      <h3>Teacher: Mr. West</h3>
      <h3>Room: A106</h3>

	  	  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Details</button> 
			   <div class="content">Fifth period I have World Lit with Mr. West, who is pretty chill so far. I have little to say about this class. It's alright. </div>
      <h2>Period 6: Chemistry</h2>
      <h3>Teacher: Mrs. Driscoll/Mrs. McHugh </h3>
      <h3>Room: S106</h3>
      <h3>Time: 11:47 - 12:34</h3>
	  	  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Details</button> 
			   <div class="content">Sixth and Seventh period I have Chemistry with Lab, but I can't remember my teachers name in that class. I do remember she is technically a sub but the standard teacher is out for maternity leave and won't be back until near the end of the year. Anyways, it's a fairly difficult class that I'm not too fond of, but it could be worse. Signifigent Figures are the dumbest thing of all time, and even my teacher knows it, but we have to follow it anyways. IT LITERALLY MAKES OUR ANSWERS <I><b>LESS TRUE</I></b> I HATE IT SO MUCH. I'M GONNA DIG UP CARL GAUSS's GRAVE AND <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_Synod">PULL A POPE</a>.</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">After School</button> 
			   <div class="content">
<ul>
    <li>I don't have any after-school activities at the moment, but have been considering joining the Esports club even though I'm not too interested in the games they play there. I've heard really bad things about League of Legends, mostly from people who play League of Legends. If there's a Dungeons and Dragons club this year I'll probably join that also.</li>
