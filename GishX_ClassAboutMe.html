<ol>
    <li>First period I have Latin with Mr. Crabb. He's a pretty good teacher(especially compared to other language teachers), but my Latin teacher last year was way nicer and more fun. I miss you Mrs. Kebernick, you were very based. Anyways I need to retake a quiz in that class because I only have a B+ in it.</li>
    <li>Second period varies. Usually I have nothing period 2 so i can chill in the library, but on Wednsdays I have community(which is a useless class by the way) and occasionally I have a wellness period because we were required to take those, and that's kinda lame.</li>
    <li>Third period I have Game and Web Design, which is why I am rambling about my classes. How do I ramble while typing? Good question.</li>
    <li>Fourth Period I have Lunch, which they should call Library cause that's where I always am, usually reading or doing homework I should have done already.</li>
    <li>Fifth period i have World Lit with Mr. West, who is pretty chill so far. I have little to say about this class. It's alright.</li>
    <li>Sixth and Seventh period I have Chemistry with Lab, but I can't remember my teachers name in that class. I do remember she is technically a sub but the standardt teacher is out for maternity leave and won't be back until near the end of the year. </li>
    <li>Last period I have Algebra 2. I am in the same class as my good friend Zander, which can be confusing when my name is Xander. We be kinda chillin' in that  class.</li>
    <li>I don't have any after-school activities at the moment, but have been considering joining the Esports club even though I'm not too interested in the games they play there. I've heard really bad things about League of Legends, mostly from people who play League of Legends. If there's a Dungeons and Dragons club this year I'll probobly join that also.</li>

      <h4> Games that Mr. Gaming likes!</h4>
      <p1>
       So some absolutely Based games are: 
          <ul>
              <li><strong>TF2</strong>. I have around <strong>700 hours</strong> in that and i'm still basically average at it because almost everyone who plays it has been playing it for years. Very high skill ceiling. it is absolutely my favorite multiplayer game. Pyro Main Supremacy.</li>
              <li><b>Dark Souls 1</b>. Seriously I swear the entire first area (undead burg) must be <i>engraved into my skull.</i> I went back and replayed it recently and it is just as good as I remember. The combat loop is absolutely fantastic. Dark Souls 3 just didn't feel as fun to me.</li>
              <li><strong>The Supreme Commander Series</strong>. Very good strategy games. Still have a dedicated community even though they’re very old.</li>
              <li><strong>Doom Eternal.</strong> I played through all of Doom in like 2 weeks it is so incredibly fun. I started  practicing it so I can beat it on Ultra Nightmare (that's the single-death difficulty btw)and it's hard as hell, <em>pun intended.</em> On that note...</li>
          </ul>
      </p1>
      <h2>Mr. Fortuna is a casual</h2>
      <p1> Mr. Fortuna is a casual, he plays Doom Eternal on Ultra-Violence instead of Nightmare, which is the intended difficulty. The fun of Doom is how intense and difficult it can be, and he is missing out by only playing on Ultra-Violence! I can understand, my first playthrough was on Ultra-Violence, but I immediately beat the game a second time on Nightmare afterwards, because I am Based and Mr. Fortuna is clearly Less Based. Still pretty based tho, because he doesn’t give out homework. Mrs. Brown is the least Based teacher and is therefore declared to be Cringe, because last year in my Intro to Computer Science class she claimed that she would teach us how to code and then only taught us Scratch and insisted that Scratch is a coding language. It’s not, it’s a toy for children and i learned it in middle school. I did not come to high school to learn <em><strong>Scratch</strong></em> Mrs. Brown. If you’re reading this, stop reading this.
