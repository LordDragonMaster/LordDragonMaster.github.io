    <h3><em><i>About Mr. Gaming</i></em></h3> 
      <p>Mr. Gaming, also known as Xander Gish, is a Based Gamer who attends <a href="https://hall.whps.org/">Hall High School</a> as a junior. He is certifiably Based. During his free time, Mr. Gaming enjoys Gaming, going on long walks, and reading.</p>

      <h4> Games that Mr. Gaming likes!</h4>
      <p1>
       So some absolutely Based games are: 
          <ul>
              <li><strong>TF2</strong>. I have around <strong>700 hours</strong> in that and i'm still basically average at it because almost everyone who plays it has been playing it for years. Very high skill ceiling. it is absolutely my favorite multiplayer game. Pyro Main Supremacy.</li>
              <li><b>Dark Souls 1</b>. Seriously I swear the entire first area (undead burg) must be <i>engraved into my skull.</i> I went back and replayed it recently and it is just as good as I remember. The combat loop is absolutely fantastic. Dark Souls 3 just didn't feel as fun to me.</li>
              <li><strong>The Supreme Commander Series</strong>. Very good strategy games. Still have a dedicated community even though they’re very old.</li>
              <li><strong>Doom Eternal.</strong> I played through all of Doom in like 2 weeks it is so incredibly fun. I started  practicing it so I can beat it on Ultra Nightmare (that's the single-death difficulty btw)and it's hard as hell, <em>pun intended.</em> On that note...</li>
          </ul>
      </p1>
      <h2>Mr. Fortuna is a casual</h2>
      <p1> Mr. Fortuna is a casual, he plays Doom Eternal on Ultra-Violence instead of Nightmare, which is the intended difficulty. The fun of Doom is how intense and difficult it can be, and he is missing out by only playing on Ultra-Violence! I can understand, my first playthrough was on Ultra-Violence, but I immediately beat the game a second time on Nightmare afterwards, because I am Based and Mr. Fortuna is clearly Less Based. Still pretty based tho, because he doesn’t give out homework. Mrs. Brown is the least Based teacher and is therefore declared to be Cringe, because last year in my Intro to Computer Science class she claimed that she would teach us how to code and then only taught us Scratch and insisted that Scratch is a coding language. It’s not, it’s a toy for children and I learned it in middle school. I did not come to high school to learn <em><strong>Scratch</strong></em> Mrs. Brown. If you’re reading this, stop reading this.
