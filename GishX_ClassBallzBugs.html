    <h1>
      OK so this game kinda buggy????
    </h1>
			<ul>
			<li>sometimes things don't reset right when you die.</li>
				<li>A certain part of one level does not collide correctly. I've set up a fix, but still don't know why this is happening.</li>
				<li>The animations for falling don't work quite right if you start falling without jumping.</li>
				<li>the physics are generally kinda broke.</li>
		</ul>
				  <h3>
    Other Issues
    </h3>
		<ul>
	<li> the victory happens too fast</li>
	<li>the credits never lets you leave.</li>		
	<li>Due to time constraints, i have not been able to flesh out the game as much as I would have wanted.</li>
	<li>Dr. War Crimes is currently only mentioned and is not yet implemented.</li>
	<li>Physics are not great</li>
	<li>Flag emojis don't work on Windows, for some reason. Not related to the game, but i'm still upset that I am unable to show my support the Albainian nation on Microsoft products.</li>
	<li>generally, the game could use another layer of polish. Or maybe a few layers of polish. Actually, just dump polish all over the damn thing.</li>
			<li>More levels would be nice.</li>
